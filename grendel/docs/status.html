However, the personality question should be answered before we open the composition window (and not in the composition window itself), so that the signature can be added automatically.</TD></TR>

Maybe we should implement the MDB interface the mail/news group created and do a simple java implementation so we maintain true cross-platform runnability. If we need speed we can use the native implementations from the mail/news group for a few platforms. These are just some thoughts.</TD></TR>

Also the javamail API contains some mime stuff and I'm not sure if it is used.  I guess this should be done by the same person who is working on the attachments.</TD></TR>
